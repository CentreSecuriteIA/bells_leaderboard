The color-coding system helps quickly identify performance levels across different metrics.

                                <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The BELLS score shows that general-purpose LLMs, when simply prompted to classify prompts as harmful or benign, consistently outperform specialized supervision systems across all key metrics. Specialized systems, often based on older models, lag behind in both adversarial and non-adversarial detection, and frequently show higher false positive rates. This highlights the “bitter lesson”: robust misuse detection is best achieved by leveraging the general capabilities of the latest LLMs, rather than relying on narrow, specialized classifiers.

                                <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The heatmap reveals that specialized supervision systems struggle to detect harmful content across many harm categories, especially for direct prompts. Some systems, like LLM Guard and Prompt Guard, fail completely in critical areas such as CBRN and Malware/Hacking. Even state-of-the-art moderation models like Llama Guard underperform compared to repurposed LLMs. This demonstrates that most specialized systems do not generalize well and often miss dangerous content unless it matches familiar harmful patterns.

                                <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Frontier models show strong performance on narrative attacks but struggle with generative attacks, while specialized systems often fail completely on syntactic transformations. LLM Guard and Prompt Guard perform well on some sophisticated jailbreaks but fail on basic syntactic transformations (e.g., base64, hex). This pattern suggests that specialized systems are often overfitted to specific attack patterns rather than developing robust content understanding, while frontier models have more general capabilities but may still have blind spots in certain areas.

                                This analysis demonstrates how supervision systems differentiate between content of varying severity levels, both in standard and adversarial scenarios. A robust supervision system should show increasing detection rates from benign to harmful content, indicating proper calibration to content severity.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Specialized supervision systems are highly sensitive to jailbreak patterns, but this does not translate to true robustness. Most only detect harmfulness when adversarial patterns are present, and often miss direct harmful requests. This is a clear example of “specification gaming”: systems are tuned to surface-level tricks rather than genuine content understanding. In contrast, general LLMs maintain higher detection rates across both direct and adversarial prompts. Specialized supervision systems often show poor calibration: they may over-trigger on benign content, under-detect direct harmful prompts, and behave inconsistently under adversarial conditions. General LLMs, while not perfect, show better calibration—higher detection for harmful content and lower false positives for benign content. However, even these models are not fully reliable, highlighting the need for both stronger models and smarter scaffolding strategies.
