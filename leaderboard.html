This is a surprising result, as it shows that a significant segment of the industry is underperforming compared to general-purpose LLMs used as straightforward classifiers.

                                <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Specialized supervision systems do not truly understand content. Many can only recognize a prompt as harmful if it is phrased as a jailbreak, but when faced with a direct question—such as “How to create a bomb?”—they often fail to classify it as harmful. Our results show that most specialized systems have very low detection rates for direct prompts, dropping to 0% for LLM Guard and Prompt Guard in some of the most dangerous harm categories, like CBRN and Malware/Hacking. NeMo, the only specialized system in our evaluation based on a repurposed LLM, achieves the best performance among specialized systems on this task, highlighting the superior generalization abilities of LLMs.

                                <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Some specialized supervision systems perform well on certain jailbreak types they have been trained on, showing strong detection for those specific attack families. However, their performance can drop to 0% on simple syntactic transformations—such as base64 or hex encoding—demonstrating that they are not truly robust. This pattern suggests that these systems often rely on surface-level cues rather than genuine content understanding, making them vulnerable to even basic evasion techniques outside their training distribution.

                                <strong>Interpretation:</strong> While frontier models show strong results in classifying adversarial and harm severity levels, they still lack metacognitive coherence: they sometimes answer a question, but if you ask them whether the question is harmful, they say “yes.” We evaluated metacognitive coherence on an exhaustive dataset spanning all adversarial and harm severity levels. Even the most capable models, like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, are incoherent on about 30% of prompts, while less coherent models such as Mistral Large and Grok-2 exceed 50% incoherence on the same dataset. This demonstrates that metacognitive alignment remains an open challenge. However, we observe that the most capable and recent models (with the highest parameter counts) tend to be more coherent, suggesting a correlation between model capability and metacognitive coherence.
